| **Dev 1** *(Backend)* | Write PostGIS spatial queries; implement hostel dropdown filtering and radius search endpoint (`GET /cycles/search?hostel=H12&radius=500`). | Proximity and hostel-filtered cycle search API running on Supabase + Render. |
| **Dev 2** *(Frontend)* | Implement native browser camera access (`` or HTML5 Canvas) for capturing bike condition photos on mobile phones; build photo preview page. | Working mobile phone camera workflow uploading photos directly from mobile browsers during key handoff. |
| **Dev 3** *(Cloud/Storage)* | Connect frontend search, booking request, and ledger screens to Dev 1 & Dev 3 backend endpoints; handle JWT session persistence in local storage/cookies. | Complete user workflow operating end-to-end between two mobile phones on public cloud URLs. |

| --- | --- | --- |
| **Dev 1** *(Backend)* | Add cancellation routes, automatic booking timeouts (expire unfulfilled requests after 30 mins), and dispute flagging APIs. | Robust backend API with error-handling edge cases in place. |
| **Dev 2** *(Frontend)* | Add active booking status banner, dispute reporting UI, offline-ready toast alerts, and final mobile UI polishing. | Polished mobile PWA optimized for seamless touch interactions during the live demo. |
| **Dev 3** *(Cloud/Storage)* | Pre-populate database with realistic test data (5–10 sample cycles across Hostel 12, Hostel 18, Tansa); manage multi-device testing; lead dry-run demos. | Verified live demo environment ready for presentation day with two smartphones. |

## Presentation Checklist for Demo Day

1. **Two Devices:** Bring two smartphones connected to cellular data (no local Wi-Fi dependency).
2. **Phone A (Owner):** Log in as **Owner (Student A, Hostel 12)** $\rightarrow$ List a cycle with an initial condition photo.
3. **Phone B (Borrower):** Log in as **Borrower (Student B, Hostel 12)** $\rightarrow$ Filter search by "Hostel 12" $\rightarrow$ Tap "Request Cycle".
4. **Handoff Sequence:**
* Phone B shows 4-digit `start_otp`.
* Phone A inputs `start_otp`, uses phone camera to take a pre-rental photo, and submits.
* State updates live to `ACTIVE` on both devices.


5. **Return & Ledger Check:**
* Phone A inputs `end_otp`, takes a post-rental photo, and submits.
* Open the **Condition Ledger** tab on either phone to show evaluators the timestamped before-and-after photo records saved in the cloud storage bucket.
